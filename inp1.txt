The bald eagle is a majestic bird. The adult bird has a brown body, brown
wings, white head, and large, hooked yellow bill. Younger birds appear all
brown.
 
Bald eagles almost always live near water because their main food source is
fish. Sometimes, however, bald eagles will eat dead animals (carrion). They
will even steal food from other birds such as ospreys and gulls! It was for
this reason that the famous patriot Benjamin Franklin preferred the wild
turkey as America's national symbol. Nevertheless, the bald eagle remains
America's symbol.
